A possible approach to test automation involves a systematic and structured process. It begins with analyzing the software application and identifying test scenarios and cases that are suitable for automation. The next step is selecting appropriate automation tools and frameworks based on the technology stack and requirements of the application. Then, the test scripts are developed, considering factors such as modularity, reusability, and maintainability. The scripts are executed using the chosen automation framework, and test results are analyzed for any failures or issues. Regular maintenance and updates to the test scripts ensure their effectiveness over time. This approach enables efficient and reliable test execution, reducing manual effort and improving overall software quality.
